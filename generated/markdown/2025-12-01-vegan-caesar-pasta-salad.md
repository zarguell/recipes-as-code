## Steps

1. Preheat your oven to 400°F. On a baking sheet, toss chickpeas with smoked
paprika and olive oil until coated, then roast for 15 minutes. Meanwhile, bring
a large pot of salted water to a boil and cook pasta until al dente, about 10
minutes, then drain. In a large bowl, toss kale with pasta and vegan parmesan
cheese. Add the roasted chickpeas and mix to combine. For the dressing, in a
blender, blend raw cashews, olive oil, lemon juice, capers, caper brine, dijon
mustard, salt, water, garlic powder, and pepper until smooth. Pour dressing over
the salad and toss to coat; serve immediately or refrigerate for up to 1 day.

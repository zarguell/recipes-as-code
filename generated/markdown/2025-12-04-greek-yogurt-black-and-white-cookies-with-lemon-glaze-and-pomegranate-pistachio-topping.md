## Steps

1. Preheat your oven to 375°F and line a baking sheet with parchment paper. In
a small bowl, combine chobani greek yogurt, whole milk, vanilla extract, lemon
zest, and almond extract.

2. In a medium bowl, cream together unsalted butter and granulated sugar for 2
minutes, or until fluffy. Add egg and mix to combine. Sprinkle baking powder,
kosher salt, and baking soda over the top. Add all-purpose flour and mix to
combine. Add the yogurt mixture (the combined yogurt, milk, vanilla, lemon zest,
and almond extract) and stir to combine before adding in the rest of the flour.
Add all-purpose flour and beat until just combined. Use a cookie scoop to place
rounded cookies on the baking sheet. Bake for 10 minutes|12%minutes until the
tops are set and bottoms are golden. Let rest on the baking sheet for 5 minutes
before transferring to a cooling rack to cool.

3. To make the icing, whisk together powdered sugar, corn syrup, lemon
zest, vanilla extract, and heavy cream until smooth. Dip the bottoms of the
cooled cookies into the icing (smooth with a spatula if needed) and sprinkle
with pomegranate seeds and pistachios. If desired, drizzle with melted dark
chocolate. Allow the icing to set before serving.
